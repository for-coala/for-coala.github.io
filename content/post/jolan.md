I’m very happy to announce that I’m joining the **ANR For-CoaLa** project.

This is a double announcement, meaning two things:
- First, I’m now an **Associate Professor** at **Université d’Orléans**! It feels like coming home, since this is where I started my research career in 2017.
- It’s also an opportunity to (once again) work with colleagues I’ve already had the chance to collaborate with:
    - **Hélène Coullon**, with whom I have been working for several years on the **decentralization of reconfiguration mechanisms**, notably leading to the creation of [**Ballet**](https://zenodo.org/records/10472116), a cross-DevOps tool based on the [**Concerto**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08233) **model**; and
    - **Frédéric Loulergue**, with whom I worked on the **formalization** and **verification** of **algorithmic skeletons** in [**SyDPaCC**](https://sydpacc.github.io/).

For-CoaLa is therefore, for me, both a continuation and a new step in my career.

I have a broad scientific background:
- **MDE** (Model-Driven Engineering),
- **HPC** (High-Performance Computing),
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** and DevOps tooling.

This breadth will bring to the project a bridge between very practical deployment concerns and more fundamental approaches, such as proofs about the semantics of **reconfiguration languages**.

This expertise also allows me to take on another role within the project: co-supervising **Olivia Proust**, a PhD candidate working on **formal verification** for **configuration management languages**.

Alongside this, I also co-supervise **Haitam El Hayani** (PhD student in Rennes) on the **extension of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) languages** within the **Taranis** project of **PEPR Cloud**. We work in collaboration with Université de Rennes on enhancing IaC capabilities and improving their integration with modern cloud deployment practices.

These two topics complement each other very naturally: on the one hand, aiming for formal guarantees in configuration management; and on the other, increasing the expressiveness and integration quality of IaC languages.

I also hold responsibilities within the GDR GPL, recently renamed **SciLog**. In particular, I co-lead the **SyLA** working group, alongside [Rabéa Ameur Boulifa](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/rabea-ameur-boulifa) and [Simon Bliudze](https://pro.univ-lille.fr/simon-bliudze), and I also co-lead the [**ADDYCT**](https://telecom-paris.hal.science/hal-05154399v1) challenge (ADaptation DYnamique et ConTinue), alongside [Jannik Laval](https://www.disp-lab.fr/fr/user/46).
